i'm nathan. i enjoy creating everything that i use in apps. here i catalogue some of those things.

not all of them are good. some of them are bad. but each served their specific purpose (which is sometimes just for fun), and often avoided the inclusion of a dependency. i think that's valuable.

i don't enable comments. but you can reach out to me directly via any method on the bottom. ✌️
